## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I got use flex box to center the container to the center of the page. I got more practice using the grid system to make 3 column layout.


### Continued development

I want to get as much practice as I can using CSS and getting more comfortable with it.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I like using MDN because it always helps me remember how to use an element.
- [Google](https://www.google.com) - If I get stuck with something I just google anything that is close to what im looking for.
